# TGCA-BRCA-classification
Classify samples based on gene expression data retrieved with GenoSurf

## Introduction
In this notebook we'll analyse data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TGCA-BRCA) data collection. This is a data repository of projects focused on studying breast cancer genotypes. The dataset comprise samples of healthy and sick patients. Each sample has a region file, where the information about genes location and expression is retained, and a metadata file with supplementary information about the sample. 

The main objective of this project is to analyze the data and train classification algorithms to predict the health status of the patient based on gene expression values. This analysis will be executed with classic machine learning algorithms and techniques.
